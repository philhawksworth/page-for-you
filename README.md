# A page for you

This web page is an example of a [JAMstack] site and can be very simple.

It might get more complex as we dig deeper. To start with though, it's just one file. And sp we can host it anywhere!

## Deploy it somewhere

You could take this file and put it on any web host. [JAMstack] sites can be nice and portable like that. To make things simple, there's a button below which will deploy it to [Netlify] for you.
